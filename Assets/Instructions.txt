Welcome to Dragon ball rpg

To play the game walk around in the open world until you encounter an Enemy 

Once in the battle mode you can either Attack, use your special, defend, or use your items

Once you have defeated an Enemy you will get 2 dragon balls 

To see your dragon balls go all the way up in the first map you load in

once you have defeated all three enemies you will have 6 dragon balls 

The last dragon ball will be found in the market and will be purchased from trunks 

After all 7 dragon balls have been found go to the area with all the dragon balls walk up to the fountain and press Enter, you have won the game

You can also enter the houses for some walking around 

We recomend that you spend some time exploring the world first just so that you know where everything is 

And remember have fun this is just a game no need to destroy your laptop and burn the house down 

**Not like we totally did that making the game :D
